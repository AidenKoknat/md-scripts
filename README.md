# md-scripts
## Python and Bash scripts that help prepare, run and analyze MD simulations for deep eutectic solvents (DESs) on GROMACS

- **DES-DES** houses scripts for simulating nultiple DESs in a box.
- **DES-IRC** scripts are for the automation of lots of simulations e.g. if you have 500 DESs to simulate and analyze.
- **DES-Water** scripts are for simulating mixtures of aqueous DES systems.
- **alpha-fold** scripts are for the analysis of the fairness of the proteing structure predictions of AlphaFold2
- **deepchem** scripts handle a host of scenarios for training ML models using the DeepChem package.
- **des-ml** scripts can be used to train ML algorithms using the HB features of DES systems. The models can predict which 
...systems will form DESs or not.
- **interface** scripts help analyze hydrogen bond properties of DES-Water inetrfaces.
- **jupyter-scripts** are a group of jupyter notebooks that make iterative analysis of MD data easier.
- **lab-gpu** scripts help with a bunch of house-cleaning operations on a local workstation.
- **metadynamics** are for running well-tempered metadynamics simulations of plastic extraction using DESs.
- **multi-view** scripts help with protein structure prediction using sequences and contact maps.
- **plastic-extraction** scripts help set up and run MD simulations for DES-Water extraction processes.
- **template-md** are boiler-plate codes for running MD simulations on HPC clusters. The scripts also calculate properties
...like RDF, HB number and lifetime.
